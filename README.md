DEVOPS is a process of improving the application delivery by ensuring Automation,Quality,continuous monitoring and tsting.

1.**Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**

The software development life cycle (SDLC) is a structured process that is used to design, develop, and test good-quality software. SDLC, or software development life cycle is a methodology that defines the entire procedure of software development step-by-ste

FRom the above picture Building, Testing and Deployment are comes under Automation.

Devops Engineer improves these 3 steps and Automate the process which increases the Efficiency.

2.**Virtualixation**

Virtualization is the creation of a virtual -- rather than actual -- version of something, such as an operating system (OS), a server, a storage device or network resources. 
Virtualization uses software that simulates hardware functionality to create a virtual system.

-> Hypervisor :-  Hypervisor is asoftware which can install virtual machines on physical servers. Examples:VMware, Xen etc.

  These Virtual machines(VM) are independent to each other and have their own memory, CPU and hardware.

3.**Linux**

ust like Windows, iOS, and Mac OS, Linux is an operating system. An operating system is software that manages all of the hardware resources associated with your desktop or laptop and manages the communication between your software and your hardware.

->Kernel is the core of an Operting system, managing hardware and coordinating memory and CPU operations.

4. **Git and git hub**

5. **Jenkins**

It is a continuus Integration(CI) tool, CI is a process of automating the building and testing of the code, each time one of the team member 
commit the changes to version control.
