DEVOPS is a process of improving the application delivery by ensuring Automation,Quality,continuous monitoring and tsting.

1.**Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**

The software development life cycle (SDLC) is a structured process that is used to design, develop, and test good-quality software. SDLC, or software development life cycle is a methodology that defines the entire procedure of software development step-by-ste

FRom the above picture Building, Testing and Deployment are comes under Automation.

Devops Engineer improves these 3 steps and Automate the process which increases the Efficiency.

2.**Virtualixation**

Virtualization is the creation of a virtual -- rather than actual -- version of something, such as an operating system (OS), a server, a storage device or network resources. 
Virtualization uses software that simulates hardware functionality to create a virtual system.

-> Hypervisor :-  Hypervisor is asoftware which can install virtual machines on physical servers. Examples:VMware, Xen etc.

  These Virtual machines(VM) are independent to each other and have their own memory, CPU and hardware.

3.**Linux**

ust like Windows, iOS, and Mac OS, Linux is an operating system. An operating system is software that manages all of the hardware resources associated with your desktop or laptop and manages the communication between your software and your hardware.

->Kernel is the core of an Operting system, managing hardware and coordinating memory and CPU operations.


4.**Git and git hub**

Git is a version control system focused on code sharing.It installs on Local system and used to manage different versions of the source code, It provides a command line interface to onteract with the files.

Git hub is a web hosted service and focused on centralized source code hosting, It is a graphical user interfacce,.

5. **Continuous Integration-Jenkins**

It is a continuus Integration(CI) tool, CI is a process of automating the building and testing of the code, each time one of the team member 
commit the changes to version control.

Jenkins is an open source automation server written in java. It helps to automate the part of software development process with continuous integration and facilitating technical ascepts of continuous delivery.


6.** Configuration-Ansible**

Anible is one of the configuration management tools

CM is the practice of handling changes systematically so that a system maintains its integrity over time.

Ansible is a configuration management platform that automates storage, servers, and networking. When you use Ansible to configure these components, difficult manual tasks become repeatable and less vulnerable to error.

7. **Infrastructure- Terraform**

Terraform is an open source “Infrastructure as Code” tool, created by HashiCorp.

-> It manages any Infrastructure 
->Tracks your Infrastructure
->Automate changes
->Standardlize configuration

8. **Containzeration-Docker**

Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly

Containers are light weight in nature
Docker container don't have complete operating system(minimum OS) because they use the resources fromthe base OS.
Acontainer is a package of Application, Application libraries, system dependencies.

9. **Kubernetes**

Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
